        "Activation functions in neural networks introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns in the data. Without them, even a deep network would simply perform linear transformations, making it incapable of modeling complex, real-world data. Activation functions allow the network to learn complex mappings between inputs and outputs, which is essential for tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition.\n",

Without non-linearity, the network, no matter how deep, would effectively only perform linear operations, limiting its capacity to solve complex problems. Nonlinear functions provide the necessary flexibility to create complex decision boundaries and improve the network’s learning capabilities."

        "Smooth and Continuous: The function is differentiable, and the gradient is smooth, which helps in gradient-based optimization.\n",
        "Vanishing Gradient Problem: For large positive or negative inputs, the gradient of the Sigmoid function becomes very small (near zero), causing slow updates during training, especially in deep networks.\n",
        "Saturation: When inputs are very large or small, the function saturates and becomes almost flat, reducing the network's ability to learn effectively.\n",

        "Sparsity: ReLU leads to sparse activations, as it outputs zero for all negative input values, which can improve the model’s ability to generalize.\n",
        "## Potential Challenges:\n",
        "Dying ReLU Problem: When the input to a ReLU neuron is always negative, it outputs zero. If this happens during training, the neuron effectively \"dies,\" meaning it stops learning entirely. This can occur if the weights are initialized poorly or if the learning rate is too high.\n",
        "Unbounded Output: Since the function has an unbounded output for positive inputs, it can sometimes lead to issues like exploding gradients, especially in deep networks.\n",

This can help in optimization because the mean of the output is centered around zero, reducing biases in weight updates compared to Sigmoid, which outputs values between 0 and 1.\n",
        "## Differences from Sigmoid:\n",
        "Range: Sigmoid outputs values between 0 and 1, while Tanh outputs values between -1 and 1. This makes Tanh more suitable when both positive and negative values need to be modeled.\n",
