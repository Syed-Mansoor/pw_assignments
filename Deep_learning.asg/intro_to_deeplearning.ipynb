        "1. **Neurons:**\n",
        "   - The building blocks of a neural network, neurons are modeled after biological neurons. They receive input, apply a transformation (usually through an activation function), and send output to subsequent layers.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Connections:**\n",
        "   - Neurons are connected to one another through **edges** or **connections** that allow information to flow between them. The strength of these connections is determined by weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Weights:**\n",
        "   - Weights are parameters that determine the importance of a particular input in the prediction process. They are adjusted during training to minimize error in the output. The larger the weight, the more influence that particular input has on the neuron's output.\n",
        "   \n",
        "4. **Biases:**\n",

        "\n",
        "3. **Output Layer:**\n",
        "   - The output layer produces the final result. For classification tasks, each neuron in this layer represents a class, and for regression tasks, it produces a continuous output.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Handling Sequential Data:**\n",
        "RNNs process data one step at a time, maintaining a hidden state that is updated at each step. This hidden state captures information about previous inputs, allowing RNNs to learn dependencies over time, making them ideal for tasks like speech recognition, language modeling, and sequence prediction.\n",
